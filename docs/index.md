# GH Pages No Jekyll
> Example of a site Github Pages site without Jekyll 

Uses Github's styling - CSS added and there's an improve this page button the bottom right.

Links have to be done differently.

Optionally use `.nojekyll` file - needed for projects with handlebars which are not Jekyll, such as some JS sites.
