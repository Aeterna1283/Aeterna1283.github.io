## Limitations


Links to markdown files have to be done differently. See below. If there broken internal links, the build will fail.


### How to write a menu

Note lack of `.md` in path. The `.md` file is there too on the server, but if you try and enter it in the URL you'll get prompted to download it.

```
- [Foo](foo)
```

If you don't use a README.md then an index file is needed.
