## Limitations

### Debugging

Github Pages error messages on a build are limited.

There is no flow for setting up this project locally, which also makes debugging harder. You could install and run Jekyll though if you need to.


### Badges

If you try and use a _shields.io_ badge inside a centered badge, the code will get shown as plain text. This is an issue on a normal Jekyll site.

So take out the centering, or use HTML instead of markdown.
