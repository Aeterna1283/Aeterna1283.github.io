# GH Pages No Jekyll
> Example of a site Github Pages site using Github's default styling

- Static site intended for docs or simple website,
- No custom styling with CSS.
- No Jekyll theme or Liquid syntax is used. 
- The Jekyll build is still run on Github Pages to convert markdown to HTML (a `.nojekyll` file would prevent this). 
- This project is not meant to be run locally.
