# GH Pages No Jekyll
> Example of a site Github Pages site using Github's default styling

- A static site intended for docs or simple website. This project is great as reference or template for those.
- No custom styling with CSS.
- No Jekyll theme or Liquid syntax is used. Where Liquid is actually used, it is code snippets and the `raw` tag is used to stop from rendering and giving an error on values no available).
- The Jekyll build is still run on Github Pages to convert markdown to HTML (a `.nojekyll` file would prevent this). 
- This project is **not** meant to be run locally (if there is a way, this is not covered here).

## What about a Wiki?

As an alternative, consider using the Wiki feature on Github.

It will give a similar Github-styled experience of doc pages that separate from the code and files, but with the benefit of a menu. Note that a Wiki lives in its own repo, so updates made independently to the main part of the repo. A Wiki has a history, but does it not work Pull Requests and reviews so the edit process is different.
